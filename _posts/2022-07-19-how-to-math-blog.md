## What Is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a Ruby-based static site generator. Its mainly useful for basic websites such as blogs or personal websites. It's primary feature is allowing you to make a website with only using markdown files, as it converts them into webpages for you.   

Although Jekyll is touted as an easy way to start a website without knowing HTML, I would highly reccomend you go over the basics if you want any customization at all. You will need to dig into the files and change certain properties to make certain things work.  

There are quite a few resources on how to set up Jekyll. I will link one here, however you don't actually need to install Ruby for it to work. I came across many many problems while trying to deploy the website locally from my computer. Simply use your free Github Pages website to host it, and you can push your work to your repo.
