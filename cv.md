### EDUCATION

**Mathematics Major, Statistics Major, Computer Science Minor**  
### RESEARCH

Research Assistant - **University of Toronto Mathematics Department** <span style="float: right; ">May 2022 - Present</span>  
Under Professor Sarah Mayes-Tang, I conducted a literature search and summarized data using a collaborative bibliographic software, analyzed short answer questions from surveys, developed research methods for analyzing research questions, and assisted in creating a Research Ethics Board application.
Research involved answering questions such as

- What are the impact calculus courses have on learners? 
- What are the high-impact teaching practices that stick with students in the long-term?  

I analyzed existing data from courses and collected my own data to attempt to answer questions like these. I used statistical calculations to analyze enrolment data and surveys, and analyzed responses on short-answer questions using content analysis through R and Python. IÂ developed research methods in consultation with the professor and other experts to collect and analyze data, according to the research questions developed.
