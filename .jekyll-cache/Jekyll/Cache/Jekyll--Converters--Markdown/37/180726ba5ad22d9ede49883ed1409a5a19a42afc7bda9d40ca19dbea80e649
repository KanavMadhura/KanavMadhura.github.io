<h3 id="research">RESEARCH</h3>

<p>Research Assistant - <strong>University of Toronto Mathematics Department</strong> <span style="float: right; ">May 2022 - Present</span><br />
Under Professor Sarah Mayes-Tang, I conducted a literature search and summarized data using a collaborative bibliographic software, analyzed short answer questions from surveys, developed research methods for analyzing research questions, and assisted in creating a Research Ethics Board application.
Research involved answering questions such as</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the impact calculus courses have on learners?</li>
  <li>What are the high-impact teaching practices that stick with students in the long-term?</li>
</ul>

<p>I analyzed existing data from courses and collected my own data to attempt to answer questions like these. I used statistical calculations to analyze enrolment data and surveys, and analyzed responses on short-answer questions using content analysis through R and Python. IÂ developed research methods in consultation with the professor and other experts to collect and analyze data, according to the research questions developed.</p>
